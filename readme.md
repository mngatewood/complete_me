ruby interface.rb
```

## Data Sets
There are two datasets used in this project:
* Dictionary, the local mac dictionary located at `/usr/local/dict/words`
* Denver Addresses, provided by the city and county of Denver, available [here](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-addresses).

## Tests
The Rakefile is setup to run all of the tests.

** It is worth noting that due to the size of the Denver address CSV the tests
can take up to a minute to complete **
